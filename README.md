# Password-Generator

created a password generator web application that allows users to generate secure passwords based on their chosen criteria. I builded this application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have styled it to provide an attractive and user-friendly experience.

Choose Length: Enter your desired password length in the input box (between 8 and 128 characters).

Select Characters: Check the boxes next to the character types you want in your password (at least one box must be selected).

Generate Password: Click the "Generate Password" button.

View Your Password: Your generated password will appear in the box above the button.

This way, users can quickly understand how to use the password generator to create a secure password with their preferred length and character types.

 if the user does not select the select character option it will provide an error message.
